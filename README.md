A C# Discord bot with various fun (and sometimes even useful!) commands.  
This is a *very* amateur project, so don't expect too much from it, and expect several bugs and performance issues. Though I like to imagine I know what I'm doing, I really don't so a lot *will* go wrong.

## Usage
**If you simply want to add the bot to your discord server**, follow [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=519292417816395779&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and select the server you want to add it to.  
*NOTE: You must have the `Manage Server` permission in order to add bots to a server*

**If you want to run it yourself** check out the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/Jolkert/Appalachia/wiki/Setup-Guide) on the wiki
